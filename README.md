# Shrub
A chrome extension providing a tree based browsing history.

# How It Works
In a conventional browser, history is very linear. If you start on some root page, and navigate to several
of it's children, the browser will only let you press forward (or backward) into the most recent of those pages.
Shrub is a small extension that aims to do this better. With Shrub installed, you are able to see every
subdirectory you've visited on a page, and navigate to any of them with one click.
